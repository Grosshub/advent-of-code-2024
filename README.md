# advent-of-code-2024

This project is a Swift template for solving Advent of Code challenges.
Inputs folder is intentionally excluded from the repository as inputs are personal to each user.

**How to Use:**
1. Create an /Inputs folder in the project root.
2. For each day, add a Swift file (e.g., InputDay01.swift) conforming to the InputProviding protocol.
3. Use the DayExecutor to run solutions by injecting the appropriate input
